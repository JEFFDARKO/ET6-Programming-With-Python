    """Sorts the elements of list `a` in ascending order and appends them to list `b`.

    Args:
        a (list): A list of common data types ( ints, floats, or strings) to be sorted and removed.
        b (list): A list to which the sorted elements from `a` will be appended.

    Returns:
        list: The updated list `b` containing the elements of `b` followed by the sorted elements of `a`.

    Raises:
        TypeError: If `a` or `b` is not a list.
        ValueError: If `a` contains non-comparable data types.

    Examples:
        >>> mystery_5([3, 1, 2], [])
        [1, 2, 3]
        >>> mystery_5([5, 3, 4], [0])
